# Facebook Cover Creator

Create a profile photo that blends with the cover photo.

Select the photos, adjust by drag and drop, and using the blue handles. Export profile and cover photos separately.

A really old tool I created many years ago in VB.NET.
The code is not clean at all.

The photo resolution is quite poor. But it still works, as facebook didn't change the profile layout (at least not on a desktop browser).
